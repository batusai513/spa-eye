                <h4>Models & Collections List</h4>
                <p>Shows a list of models which were created while Backbone-Eye was running. Each model shows application level attributes only. Quickly narrow down a model by searching for attribute values. Pin down models whose behavior needs further investigation. Or allow Backbone-Eye to present those models which have been accessed the most during introspection.</p>

                <h4>View interaction trails and Journals</h4>
                <p>Select a model or collection to see it's interaction trail and journal. The interaction trail shows the model (or collections) interaction with other Backbone entities. The journal logs activities which have happened on the selected model. Change an attribute value from the application (or Backbone-Eye) to see it's impact on other views and entities</p>

                <h4>View List</h4>
                <p>A list of views which were created while Backbone-Eye was running. Identify views by hovering over your application screens. The underlying Backbone Views will automatically be highlighted. Similarly, click on Backbone Views to see what application screen they correspond to. Backbone-Eye also attempts to associate templates with views. </p>

                <h4>Debug Templates</h4>
                <p>Backbone-Eye allows for debugging of view templates. The id of the template is used to set a breakpoint in the view. Data passed to the template as well as incremental generation of the HTML string can be observed while stepping through the generated template code.</p>

    Backbone Eye extends the popular <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/">Firebug</a> plugin for Firefox. Once installed successfully, a new tab called Backbone Eye will appear in Firebug.
        <img src="./site/img/virgin.png" alt="Getting started"/><br/>Navigate to an URL to begin introspecting. To explain the various features of Backbone Eye, we will use the <a href="http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/">Backbone TODO application</a> as our reference application.

<div id="models">
    <br/><br/><br/>
    <div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-heading">Models Section</div>
    <div class="well well-lg">
        This section lists out all the models which were discovered by Backbone Eye and is the starting point for discovering model behavior.<br/>

        <br/><h4>Model categorization</h4><br/>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <td><img src="./site/img/allsections.png" alt="Pinned, Most Used and All subsections in Models perspective"/></td>
                <td>
                    This section has three sub sections.
                    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                        <dt>Pinned</dt>
                        <dd>Right click and select "Pin model" to nail down a model (among all application models) to investigate. All pinned models will reside in this section. Which model to pin may be discovered by using the Backbone Eye <a href="#model.search">search</a> functionality</dd>
                        <dt>Most Used</dt>
                        <dd>Backbone Eye attempts to identify the models that are most used by the application (based on write access counts). In real world applications which could have a large number of models, this list can be used as a starting point for investigating application behavior.</dd>

                        <dd>Lists all the models which were discovered.</dd>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <br/><h4>Enumeration of Model attributes</h4><br/>
        Backbone Eye only enumerates application specific model properties and hides internal Backbone properties. Internal properties can be viewed - if required - in the journal and interaction trails views. <br/><img src="./site/img/model_attributes.png" alt="Shows only model attributes"/><br/>

        <br/><h4>Edit model attributes</h4><br/>

        Backbone Eye allows you to edit the value of a model attribute to see the ripple effect - that model change - has on the entire application. To edit any attribute value, double click on the attribute name of the specific model and change it to a new value.<br/>
        <br/><span class="label label-info">Internals</span>: This maps to model.set({attribute_name:value})<br/>
        <br/><span class="label label-success">Simulate "what-if" scenarios</span> : In the todo example, it is possible to change the model value from the UI as well (Primarily because it is editable, visible on the screen etc). But in the general case, it may be difficult to use application screens to edit  model values. This feature will help you simulate what-if scenarios by allowing to update model attributes directly. To see the impact of the update, use the model <a href="#trails">interaction trails</a>.<br/></span><br/>
        <br/><img src="./site/img/model_editattributes.png" alt="Edit attributes"/><br/>


        <br id="model.search"/>
        <br/><br/><h4 >Search for models to investigate</h4><br/>
        Search can be either case sensitive or case insensitive. Valid search strings are
        <ol>
            <li>attributename:value</li>
            <li>(partial) or full attribute name</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><td>Search by partial attribute values</td></tr>
            <tr><td><img src="./site/img/search_attribute_value.png" alt="Search by value"/></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Narrow further by specifying a attribute name</td></tr>
            <tr><td><img src="./site/img/search_attribute_keyvalue.png" alt="Search by key:value"/></td></tr>
        </table>

        <br/><h4>Nail down a model</h4><br/>

        Use the <b>pin</b> command to nail down models to investigate. Typically, <a href="#model.search">search</a> would precede the pin command.<br/>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><td>Pin a model</td></tr>
            <tr><td><img src="./site/img/pin.png" alt="Pin a model"/></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Un Pin a model</td></tr>
            <tr><td><img src="./site/img/unpin.png" alt="Un Pin a model"/></td></tr>
        </table>
        Pinned models (and any other model - for that matter) can be selected by clicking on it to view it's <a href="#journals">journal</a> or <a href="#trails">interaction trails</a>.<br/>

        <br/><h4>Model Activity Indicators</h4><br/>

        Models having updates are momentarily highlighted with a colored band to draw user attention to model activity.<br/>

        <table class="table">
            <tr><td>Update a Model</td></tr>
            <tr><td><img src="./site/img/highlight.png" alt="Model being highlighted due to activity"/></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Destroy a Model</td></tr>
            <tr><td><img src="./site/img/highlight2.png" alt="Model being highlighted due to activity"/></td></tr>
        </table>

<div id="collections" >
    <br/><br/><br/>
    <div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-heading">Collections Listing</div>
    Similar to the Models section, it shows all collections discovered by Backbone Eye so far. <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="./site/img/coll_interaction.png" alt="Collection interaction trail"/><br/>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="trails" >
    <br/><br/><br/>
    <div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-heading">Interaction Trails</div>
    This section shows a sequence of interactions which have occurred on the selected model as a result of standard Backbone write operations - save, fetch, set, destroy, reset and sort among others. The trails has a graphical section which shows overall flow characteristics at a glance. The tabular section - on the other hand - shows the state of the model at various time points of the flow (as well as  parameters which were passed in at that time point). This would be useful to work backwords to infer observed application behavior.<br/>

    <br/><span class="label label-default">Note</span> Also works on selected collection and view.<br/>
    <br/><span class="label label-default">Note</span> Read operations are deliberately not shown as they don't change application state (and will only contribute to investigative noise). In future versions, we may have an option to switch on this behavior.<br/>

    <br/><img src="./site/img/interaction_plot_table.png" alt="Model interaction trail"/><br/>

    <br/>The view shows the interactions which have happened at time t = 0, 1, 2 ... n. To view a interaction at t = m, click on the t = m header. The diagram shows the flow at that time slow. Expand the t=m section to see detailed info about the state of the entity(model, collection or view), params passed in etc.

    <br id="trails_clear">
    <br/><br/><h4>Clear Interaction Trails and Journal data</h4><br/>
    <div id="clear">
        For complex applications, this data can grow and Backbone Eye can become sluggish. Click on the clear button to reset this data.<br/>
        <br/><img src="./site/img/clear_it.png" alt="Clear interaction trail data"/><br/>
        <br/><img src="./site/img/clear_j.png" alt="Clear journal data"/><br/>
        It is also possible to <b>not</b> record this data. Toggle the eye button to stop or start recording this data<br/>

</div>
<div id="journals" >
    <br/><br/><br/>
    <div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-heading">Journal</div>
    Unlike the <a href="#trails">interaction trails</a>, the journal shows all activities which have happened on that specific model (or collection or view) at various time slots. It can be used to quickly check the evolution of model state over a period of time - as well as the various operation details which caused the state change.<br/>
    <br/><img src="./site/img/journal.png" alt="Journal data"/><br/>

        <br/><span class="label label-default">Note</span> Also works on selected collection and view.<br/>

        <br/><span class="label label-default">Note</span> Remember that this data can be cleared out as described <a href="#trails_clear">here</a><br/>

<div id="views">
    <br/><br/><br/>
    <div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-heading">Views</div>

    <br/><h4>View Categorization</h4><br/>
    A listing of view objects discovered by Backbone Eye. This section has two sub sections.
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./site/img/view_sections.png" alt="All, Removed subsections in Views perspective"/></td>
            <td>

                <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                    <dt>Removed</dt>
                    <dd>Lists all the views which have been removed (inferred when view.remove is invoked by the application)</dd>
                    <dt>All</dt>
                    <dd>Lists all the views which were discovered.</dd>
                </dl>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>


    <h4>Template inference</h4><br/>
     Backbone Eye <b>infers</b> templates which may have been used to render the views. In case a template-id was not specified in the application, a dummy template-id is assigned (starting with template_). This becomes the surrogate key of the template. These templates are visible in Firebug's Script Panel.<br/>
        <br/><img src="./site/img/view_templatelisting.png" alt="View Templates shown in the source box of Firebug script panel"/><br/>

    <br/><h4>Debug the view generation process</h4><br/>
        View templates can NOW be debugged! <br/>

        The list of templates discovered by Backbone Eye are now present in the source box of the script section of Firebug.<br/><br/><img src="./site/img/view_templatelisting.png" alt="View Templates shown in the source box of Firebug script panel"/><br/><br/>The Javascript code to transform the the template is shown in the source box. The source is commented with the template tags so it is easy to see what code transforms that template snippet. The script panel has a new side-panel : Views. When a view template is being debugged, this panel becomes active and shows the data being passed to the template, the source template and the incremental template string being populated with data as the debugger steps through the template building process.<br/><br/><img src="./site/img/view_debug.png" alt="Debug a view template"/><br/>

    <br/><h4>Identify a View</h4><br/>

    <h6>From Backbone Eye</h6><br/>
    Click on a view object in Backbone Eye to see the corresponding screen highlighted in the application.
    <br/><img src="./site/img/view_click.png" alt="Click on a view to see it in the application screen"/><br/>
    <br/><h6>From Application Screens</h6><br/>
    Alternatively, using the inspector, select a screen in the application. The corresponding view in Backbone Eye will be highlighted and expanded.

        <br/><span class="label label-success">Note</span> Use this to identify a backbone view for the corresponding application screen<br/>
    <br/><img src="./site/img/view_iclick.png" alt="Click on inspector to see the application screen in the view section"/><br/>
